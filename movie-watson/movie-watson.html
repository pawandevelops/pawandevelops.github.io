            <h3>My latest movie review:</h3>

            <div id="latest-movie">
                <h3>Knives Out</h3>

                <p> <i> <b>Knives Out (2019)</b> </i> is a classical whodunit mystery. The first remarkable thing about the film is its cast, which is great and apt. The plot is clever and surprises you to till the very end. Knives Out is compelling and good
                    paced story, which gets interesting as it progresses, and therefore leaves you clinging to it till the climax when all events are properly established and logically placed in the puzzle.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very famous and rich mystery novelist is dead, and there is an investigation to ascertain the reasons for what seems to be a suicide. But is it a suicide or is there something more to it? The police investigators and
                    a private detective are set out to establish what happened. They also interrogate to the novelist's family members and other related persons.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story reveals itself before the audience, while the detectives have to work to fit in the clues to solve the mystery. And when you think that, "this is it. Its over now", a new twist awaits you. You can guess all
                    you want and that's the fun part, but better be it that you don't get too much into guessing. I say this because this guessing business may deprive you, up to a certain extent, of getting entertained by the movie.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two roles from the movie stand out, if I were to say honestly. These are Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), the private investigator and Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), the nurse. I liked the character and dialogue delivery style
                    of Benoit Blanc. He is a bit mysterious, but not a pretentious 'I-know-it-all' smart detective as is portrayed in many a films. Marta Cabrera's character is likeable and Ana has done a splendid job.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest of the cast, I have no complaints. I only wish that Toni Collete's and Michael Shannon's roles could've been more detailed or insidious and more mysteriously involved in the 'suicide' plot. Maybe its my wishful
                    thinking, but still, I would have been fun. And please don't draw any conjectures after reading this. Watch the movie with no expectations about the storyline.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cinematography, the feel of the house and the set design seem to fit right into the plot of the movie. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie has its own flaws, and a few things remain unanswered or unexplained. I hope they had given proper closures to a few things. But, we can certainly neglect those things.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like me and many movie buffs, there are a few memorable scenes which you can re-watch from time to time, as is the case with our favourite movies.</p>

                <p>Last words: Go and watch it for sure. <b> Satisfaction Guaranteed.</b></p>

                        <h3 class="pointer">Training Day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <div class="fa fa-chevron-right rotate"></div>
                        </h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you are trained in a particular way to do your job. And this job of yours involves a commitment to ethics and morality. You are on the job as a police officer and you are to be evaluated by a corrupt
                            policeman. Then what will you do? Would you uphold your ethics and integrity or would you readily agree to everything this corrupt police officer will tell you to do so as to remain in his good books?</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> <b>Training Day (2001)</b> </i>is based on this theme. Don't worry I am not revealing anything more than this. As I want this movie commentary to be free of spoilers. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Training Day Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is under evaluation headed by Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alonzo is a corrupt and cunning officer, who is in police work to work solely for his own monetary benefit. For this purpose, he is ready to get his hands dirty and use his powers to manipulate and intimidate
                            others. He also compels Officer Hoyt to be a part of his shady deals and crimes. Hoyt is reluctant and is not ready to indulge in crime and corruption.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can guess, a lot of things would take place with Hoyt for which he is not ready at all. He would see the ugly side of other police officers. He would go through a hell lot of things on his 'training day'.
                            Will he be able to survive the day? Will Hoyt survive after knowing the shady business of Alonzo? To get your answers, you will have to see it yourselves in the Training Day.</p>

                        <p><b>Now, regarding the performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in Training Day:</b></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denzel is totally into his character of Alonzo Harris. He is smart, crass, outspoken, cunning, insidiously corrupt, good in hiding his motivations and rationalising his wrong doings. To some, at a first glance,
                            he may seem like a policeman with some quirk, delinquency and a little bit of notorious carelessness. But it is not the case.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alonzo reveals his true character to Officer Hoyt. And he does this without any moral compunction and with an air of impunity. He is well aware that Hoyt is powerless before him and he can get away with anything
                            big.
                        </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to portray a character like Alonzo, one's acting prowess must be more than a regular garden variety actor. And hence, Denzel enters into the realm of method acting (or at least I can say so). He seems real
                            and legit and I bet you would say the same after watching the movie or would say so if you have watched it already.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't bore with more analysis of Denzel's character in the Training Day. So, now we move on to Ethan's character of Officer Hoyt.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officer Hoyt is potrayed as a police officer who is relatively new and has not lost his sense of justice, responsibility and integrity. He is ready to ignore a few odd instances of delinquent behaviour or shady
                            dealings of Alonzo. But he has some serious reservations on participating in Alonzo's nefarious schemes. Although, one may say Hoyt is not strictly a 'by-the-book' cop having an immense fighting spirit, but he sure knows how
                            to survive and play along for his own good.
                        </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dynamic between Alonzo and Hoyt is interesting. Alonzo puts Hoyt in many uncomfortable positions and tries to suck him up in his plan, with some kind of safety net to save himself (Alonzo). </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say Training Day's story is an 'ordinary' one. But Denzel and Ethan's performances have added life to it, especially Denzel's. I am not exaggerating or being a blind fan. His style grown on you; Alonzo
                            becomes a memorable character. So much so that it became an Oscar for Best Actor performance and rightly so. <b>Even the critics have praised Denzel and Ethan.</b> </p>

                        <p>Enough said. Now go and watch this 7.7 IMDB rated movie - The Training Day. </p>

                        <h3 class="pointer">Crimson Tide &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <div class="fa fa-chevron-right rotate"></div>
                        </h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you like films which portray tension and ideological struggle within a group? Do you like submarine or armed forces related movies ? Would you like to see Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman in their best performances
                            and developed characters? Then, <i> <b>Crimson Tide (1995)</b> </i> is the right choice.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would happen if the survival of the world was to depend on the decisions made by two officers inside a submarine loaded with nuclear ballistic missiles? And what if there is a conflict due to different interpretations
                            of a nuclear launch order between the commanding officer and his executive officer?</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimson Tide delves into such questions and depicts it dramatically with intensity and tension. On an abstract level, the film also shows a conflict between two people of entirely different dispositions. One is
                            a command obeying, no-questions-asked person who believes in getting a job done. The other is a sophisticated person who understands his role in the scheme of things and what repercussions his actions may produce.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this clash of personality, a serious situation emerges inside the submarine. The USS Alabama receives an order to launch nuclear missiles. But due to some problems, the captain (Gene Hackman) and the
                            executive officer (Denzel Washington) do not agree at their received set of nuclear launch codes. There is some ambiguity over these launch codes as the latest nuclear codes remain incomplete. The captain wants to follow the
                            last order regardless, while the executive officer thinks the latest orders need to be affirmed first. All this leads to a lot of tension between the rest of the crew and divides them in two camps.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plot is fast paced, engaging and interesting. Gene and Denzel have performed well, but I found other actors were diminished by the two's brilliance and centrality in the plot. And I don't blame it, because
                            the plot is so. But still, things would have been better if other characters would've found prominence. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the submarine stuff: the drills, the disciplined execution of tasks, the friction between other officers, the tension laden atmosphere inside the submarine, the submarine warfare etc make the movie intriguing,
                            especially for people who have very little idea about how things work in the armed forces. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the movie, I was impressed. The climax of Crimson Tide was satisfying, though a few questions remained unanswered or were not provided a proper closure in the movie. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may say that <a href="https://collider.com/crimson-tide-best-submarine-movies/" alt="Why 'Crimson Tide' Is One of the Greatest Submarine Movies Ever Made" target="_blank">Crimson Tide is a good submarine movie</a>,
                            as it is a riveting pop-drama which makes you talk about the decisions or actions taken in the film after watching it.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are people who find a lot of problems in the plot and <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19950627&slug=2128502" alt="Crimson Tide Vs. Reality - Hollywood Takes Some Liberties With Life Aboard A Trident Submarine"
                                target="_blank">the liberties Crimson Tide has taken</a> to depict things and scenarios inside a nuclear missile armed submarine. I understand the movie makers might have decided to take liberties because it is a hollywood
                            movie and being entertaining would be a priority rather than getting into technical details.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, Crimson Tide is a movie which is riveting and thrilling. The transition between sub-plots is smooth and add to the overall development of the two main characters and story. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is even remotely interested in watching movies related to warfare, submarines or power politics. Besides, you can watch Crimson Tide for all the suspense and
                            superb acting of Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington.</p>

                        <h3 class="pointer">The Terminal &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <div class="fa fa-chevron-right rotate"></div>
                        </h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched <i> <b>The Terminal (2004)</b> </i> on a channel on the TV (Those were the times when the internet wasn't common and I had no access to DVDs in our part of the world.) </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as it has happened with all of us at one time or other, I accidentally came across this film. I started watching it when it was almost in midway of its run. Anyhow, I watched it till the end.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in my first introduction to The Terminal, I developed an interest in Frank Dixon (played by Stanley Tucci). He intrigued me, I was like, "why is this man after Viktor (Tom Hanks) ?", and "Why does he behave
                            in this particular way?". </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to an internal strife in his country, Krakozhia Viktor Navorski's (Tom Hanks) passport becomes invalid and he is rendered stateless. All this happens while he was at New York's John F Kennedy International
                            Airport. Since he is not allowed to enter United States and cannot return back to his own country. As a result he is stuck at the airport. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not prepared for this situation. Of course, nobody may be prepared for such a surprise.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuck in a foreign land, with a little knowledge of English, and nowhere to go, Victor is now living at the airport terminal. This movie is about his days spent on the airport.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of his stay on the airport, Viktor accomplishes many a things. He is able to learn English, makes new friends with the staff and passengers working on the airport, gets a temporary job, figures
                            out various ways to earn some money while being at the airport, saves people in distress, has a tussle with Frank Dixon, falls in love, among other things. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strikes me about Frank's character is that he is not bitter about his tough times at the airport. He is mostly calm, composed and just patiently looks forward for the situation to be normal again. We can
                            learn a lot of life lessons from Viktor's character. He is about living life in a humble way and face difficulties in it with grace, astuteness and patience.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) becomes a person of interest for Viktor. He tries to woo her. He shares his secret of the need to visit the United States. Will Viktor be able to win her heart, and would he
                            be able to </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other characters in the film such as Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), Officer Dolores Torres (Zoë Saldana), Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), Officer Judge (Barry Henley) have played their parts well. These characters have
                            provided the movie with enough humour, and their activities are interrelated to Viktor.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two incidents from the film are worth mentioning here. First, when Viktor saves a person who had some problems with paperwork of prescription medicines. This earns him his epithet of Viktor "the goat" Navorski.
                            Second, he enables two people to get married while acting as a kind of mediator between them. There are several other moments from the film which are equally fun and engaging. Remember, sometimes it is about the journey itself
                            rather than the destination. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will become of Viktor? Will he be able to get into the United States? Will he be deported? What will happen with his temporary friends? Will he be able to achieve various tasks as he comes across them on
                            the airport? Will Dixon go easy on Viktor? To find the answer to all these questions, watch this sweet and lovely movie: The Terminal.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: According to Wikipedia, "The film is partially inspired by the true story of the 18-year stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in Terminal 1 of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, from 1988 to 2006." Mind blowing,
                            isn't it? Also, the lovely theme song of the movie hums in your mind long after you have seen the movie, true story !</p>
